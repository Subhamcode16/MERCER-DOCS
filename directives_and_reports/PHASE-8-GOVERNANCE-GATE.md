# Post-Phase-8 Governance Gate Review

**Document Status:** FORMAL GOVERNANCE GATE REPORT  
**Phase:** 8 (Security State Reconciliation & Consistency Boundary)  
**Governance Baseline:** `ARCH-IMPLEMENTATION-BOUNDARY-001`, `RESEARCH-TRUST-001`, `RESEARCH-TRUST-002`, `RESEARCH-TRUST-003`  
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 through Phase 7 COMPLETE & RATIFIED

## 1. Final Gate Verdict

**VERDICT: PASS WITH LIMITATIONS**

Phase 8 (`Security State Reconciliation & Consistency Boundary`) is **IMPLEMENTED, SECURITY-REVIEWED, AND VERIFIED**.

All 183 Pytests pass cleanly in 12.33 seconds.

## 2. Gate Verification Checklist

- [x] `SecurityReconciler` exists and is strictly non-authoritative.
- [x] Reconciliation models have strict schema and type validation (`isinstance(val, bool)` checks).
- [x] Cross-record identity, correlation, and provenance binding is enforced.
- [x] Conflict, incomplete, and quarantined records remain explicit.
- [x] Audit chain integrity failures are detected and surfaced as `INCONSISTENT`.
- [x] Snapshot digests and result commitments are deterministic and tamper-detectable via SHA-256 and `hmac.compare_digest`.
- [x] Phase 4 research evidence cannot escalate to production trust.
- [x] Phase 3 recovery semantics remain unchanged and non-authoritative.
- [x] `ExecutionGate` remains fail-closed (`is_permitted() == False`).
- [x] `EpistemicState` remains unmutated by Phase 8.
- [x] No forbidden production integrations (HSM, YubiKey, ZKP, TEE, BFT) are introduced.
- [x] AST static analysis isolation tests pass 100%.
- [x] Reflection audit isolation tests pass 100%.
- [x] Thread-safe concurrency tests pass 100%.
- [x] Sensitive material leakage scanning tests pass 100%.
- [x] All 159 Phase 1–7 baseline tests pass.
- [x] All Phase 8 new tests pass.
- [x] All five Phase 8 documentation deliverables are complete.

## 3. Explicit Limitations & Governance Directives for Subsequent Work

1. **Non-Authoritative Boundary:** `SecurityReconciler` provides read-oriented consistency visibility ONLY. `CONSISTENT` status must NEVER be interpreted as execution authorization.
2. **Execution Gate Protection:** No future phase may use `ReconciliationResult` to unlock `ExecutionGate`.
3. **Audit Immutable Log Protection:** Reconciliation may evaluate audit chain continuity but cannot rewrite, delete, or repair historical audit records.
4. **Phase 4 Prototype Boundary:** Phase 4 FROST artifacts remain isolated research code and must not be imported into production security paths.
